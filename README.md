# Monty Team Project

The Monty language is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes. It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
A language interpreter made in the C programming language to manage stacks and queues (LIFO and FIFO). The aim is to interpret Monty bytecodes files. Monty is a language that aims to close the gap between scripting and programming languages.
